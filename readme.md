# The Record

## Introduction

The Record is a little platform for vinyl collectors. It provides tools to manage your collection and gives insights in various statistics regarding a collection, e.g. distribution among genres, favourites, value, weight, and many more. It also helps to rediscover your collection and integrates seemlessly with various APIs like Discogs, iTunes, Soundcloud, Youtube and others. In addition FTR allows you to listen to your records and connect with your friends and other collectors to keep you up to date with their progression.

FTR is realized using Laravel 5
